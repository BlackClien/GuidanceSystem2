# How The System Works?

## System Main Page
- This form is not yet final. I (as a programmer) did not put the "About Us" text to the About Us button at the right corner.
- Click the **Login to manage appointments** button to bring you to the login page.

## Login Form
- This form will be used by the **Counselor** and **Admin** only, each of them has an existing username and password. The passwords are already hashed.
  - Admin credentials:
    - Username: `Admin`
    - Password: `CedarAdmin123`
  - Counselor credentials:
    - Username: `Counselor`
    - Password: `CedarCounselor123`
